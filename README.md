# How to play
Each planet has a portal that takes the player to a level. In order to use the portals, all of the stars in its location must be collected.
There are four planets, each with an increasing level of difficulty. When a level is complete, the player must use a spaceship to find the next planet (following the red arrow).
The player can die from falling off the platforms in each level, and by approaching monsters. In order to win the game, all of the stars must be collected.
